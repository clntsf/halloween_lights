## Project 1: Halloween Lights

###    1.1 Initial Ideas

1. A device to scare passers-by, record their voices, and then play them back to the next person.</p>
    > _This idea was considered but put aside due to considerations of the complexity of the required setup and the necessity of a device capable of both recording and playing back sound._

2. A device which detects vibrations and turns on a strip of appropriately-colored LED lights, maybe playing a pre-recorded sound clip.
    > _This idea was chosen due to its relatively low hardware requirements, its simple yet rewarding concept, and the general interest of the group._

###     1.2 Required Objects

 - BBC Microbit
    > _This will play the role of both sound input and output, as well as containing the script (written in python) to control the artefact's behaviour_
 - LED Strip
    > _For displaying colored lights when a sound is detected_
 - Connecting board
    > _used to connect the Microbit to the LED Strip, allowing it to send signals and interact with the LEDs on it_

###     1.3 Online Resources
