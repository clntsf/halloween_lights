## Project 1: Halloween Lights

###    1.1: Initial Ideas:

1. A device to scare passers-by, record their voices, and then play them back to the next person.</p>
    > _This idea was considered but put aside due to considerations of the complexity of the required setup and the necessity of a device capable of both recording and playing back sound._

2. A device which detects vibrations and turns on a strip of appropriately-colored LED lights, maybe playing a pre-recorded sound clip.
    > _This idea was chosen due to its relatively low hardware requirements, its simple yet rewarding concept, and the general interest of the group._

###     1.2: Required Objects:

###     1.3: Writing the Code
